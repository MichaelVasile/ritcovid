# RIT COVID-19 Tracker Discord Bot by Mike Vasile

The RIT COVID-19 Tracker is a Python-based Discord bot that uses Galen Guyer's [RIT COVID Dashboard API](https://ritcoviddashboard.com/api/v0/latest), which scrapes data from [RIT's COVID-19 Dashboard](https://rit.edu/ready/dashboard). Hooray for teamwork.

The bot is currently on version __3.1__. Woo!

## What can it do?

The bot utilizes the aforementioned API to pull the latest data from RIT's COVID dashboard, and will present that in a Discord embed. That's it really :)

## Interested in contributing or adding this to your server?
