# RIT COVID-19 Tracker Discord Bot

RITCOVID is a Python-based Discord bot that uses the BeautifulSoup 4 API to scrape data from RIT's COVID-19 Dashboard.

## What can it do?

In it's current iteration, the bot can:
- Get the current RIT COVID-19 alert level
- Send alerts to specified Discord channels when the alert level changes
- Get current statistics from the RIT COVID-19 Dashboard

## Things I'm working on

This was thrown together in my free time, so it is kind of janky right now. For a version 2.0, I'm looking to:
- Make it more efficient in scraping data
- Have actual data persistence using sqlite3
- Use Matplotlib to create graphs
- Be able to be dynamically bound to specific channels without having to rely on environment variables
